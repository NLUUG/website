## Abstract

The presentation is about the IETF standardization organization, its objectives, the process and the organization. How are internet standards established, what are the steps to get from an idea, via the IETF process, to a document that describes an internet protocol? The resulting documents must be so complete that different implementations of the protocol are interoperable.
