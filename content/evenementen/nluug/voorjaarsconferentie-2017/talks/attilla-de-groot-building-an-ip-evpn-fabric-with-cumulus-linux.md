## Abstract

Cumulus Linux is a NOS that runs on 50+ different hardware platforms used in datacenters. EVPN is a new RFC that allows to build a L2 overlay network with BGP as the control plane. This makes it possible to offer “classic” L2 services on a scalable IP fabric. This presentation will show how to deploy EVPN-VxLAN in a datacenter network with Ansible as a DevOps tool.
