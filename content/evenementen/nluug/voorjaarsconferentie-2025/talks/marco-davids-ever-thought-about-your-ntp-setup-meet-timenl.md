## Abstract

Accurate time synchronization is a cornerstone of the internet, yet many organizations overlook the reliability and security of their NTP setup. From secure transactions to system logs and network coordination, precise timing is essential. But how do you ensure your time source is accurate, secure, and resilient?

In this talk, we explore the critical role of NTP in maintaining a synchronized internet and the potential risks of relying on unverified time sources. We introduce TimeNL, a Dutch initiative providing a highly accurate and robust NTP service based on atomic clocks and multiple GNSS signals. Learn how a good NTP strategy can enhance the reliability of your network's time synchronization and why choosing the right time source matters more than you think.
