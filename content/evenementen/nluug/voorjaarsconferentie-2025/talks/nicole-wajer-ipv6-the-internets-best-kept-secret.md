## Abstract

This presentation seeks to shed light on IPv6, often dubbed as the "Internet's Best Kept Secret". Despite being designed to replace the widely used IPv4 and address its limitations, IPv6 has experienced surprisingly low adoption rates. This presentation will explore the reasons for this paradox, focusing on the seamless functionality of IPv6 that often keeps its usage hidden from the end user.
