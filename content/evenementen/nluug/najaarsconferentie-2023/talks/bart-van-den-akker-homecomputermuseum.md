## Abstract

The HomeComputerMuseum is an interactive computermuseum dedicated to preserve and share the history of the home computer. It opened its doors in 2018 and grew to become one of the largest and most influential computermuseums in the world. The museum is completely independent of subsidy or sponsors and remains in business by offering unique data recovery services, helping people with a distance to the labour market and helping other museums to follow the same example as the HomeComputerMuseum. One could argue, we are an open-source museum. The talk is about why we exist, how we exist today and why the HomeComputerMuseum is important.

## Biografie
