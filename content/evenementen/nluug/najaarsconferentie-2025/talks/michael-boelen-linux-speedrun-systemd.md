## Abstract

Most Linux systems nowadays use systemd to perform its system and service management. You may be familiar with some of its commands, such as journalctl and systemctl. But are you getting really everything out of systemd on your systems?

After my last presentation about systemd security, I received the feedback: I never saw some of these commands before. Enough reason to take an alternative approach this time. Let's do it like a gamer's speedrun! We aim for covering as much ground as possible, learning commands, flags, and undiscovered features along the way. Are you ready? Let's go!
