## Abstract

If you work as an IT professional chances are that you spend a great deal of your time on creating documentation. Want to learn how to create documents that are built from reusable bits, may contain generated diagrams and styled beautifully for both on-line and printed medium? As it is often the case, the right tooling and process can transform a tedious and error-prone chore into a fulfilling activity. 

In this session you'll see a demonstration of creating documentation as if it would be code. We'll consider the necessary skills - like Markdown, RST and version control - and using some handy tooling ([Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com ), [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) or [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) and [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/)) we'll demo a few examples of how to create different types of documents, such as technical articles, project documentation, presentation slides, contracts, invoices or even your very own parametrized CV generator.

In addition, for those who need it, the approach supports Git based collaboration and automated build pipelines out of the box.
