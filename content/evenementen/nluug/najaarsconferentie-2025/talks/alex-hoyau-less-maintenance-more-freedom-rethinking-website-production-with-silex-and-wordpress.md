## Abstract

Let’s dive into why the WordPress ecosystem, with its proprietary plugins, often means more maintenance and less freedom for everyone in the web production chain—agencies, project leads, and freelancers alike. We’ll show how [Silex](https://www.silex.me), by sticking to open standards like HTML and CSS and embracing a no-code approach, lets you build lightweight, truly open-source static sites without the usual complexity. It’s all about simplifying your workflow, boosting security, and giving you no-code freedom at scale.
