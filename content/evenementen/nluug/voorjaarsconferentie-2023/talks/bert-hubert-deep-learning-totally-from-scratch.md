## Abstract

Deep learning/generative AI is taking the world by storm. Until late 2022 I had mostly dismissed all of this as hype, but the advent of ChatGPT made it impossible to ignore this any longer. By now there are tons YouTube videos telling you how you too can script up "an AI". If you feel like I did in 2022 that you must catch up rapidly, these videos are not the way to go.

I have created a "Hello Deep Learning" project which explains the essence of deep learning absolutely from scratch. By this I mean an empty directory. In this presentation we'll build an OCR solution that can read actual handwritten letters, absolutely from scratch.

The goal of "hello deep learning" is to get in on the ground floor so you can start learning more, while actually knowing what is going on.

## Biografie
