## Abstract

After several talks about Hardware Hacking this talk will be one on a more serious matter. After someone takes their life and the police closes their case, the next of kin may still have questions that are left unanswered.

This talk is about our journey from being nerds helping out with computer problems to specialists trying to help the next of kin find answers to questions they might still have.
