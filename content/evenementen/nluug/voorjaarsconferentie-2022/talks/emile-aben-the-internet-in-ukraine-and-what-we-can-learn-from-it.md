## Abstract

We have been monitoring the situation of the Internet in Ukraine. We would like to share observations on the resilience of the Internet in Ukraine and lessons learned from that.

## Biography

I'm a system architect/research coordinator at the RIPE NCC, where I work in R&D. I'm a chemist by training, but have been working since 1998 on Internet related things, as a sysadmin, security consultant, web developer and researcher.

I am interested in technology changes (like IPv6 deployment), Internet measurement, data analysis, data visualisation, sustainability and security. I'd like to bring research and operations closer together, ie. do research that is operationally relevant.
