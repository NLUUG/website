## Abstract

From the open-source revolution to the rise of generative AI, we find ourselves at a crossroads of unprecedented legal and ethical dilemmas. Can a bot create art in the style of a human artist without infringing on copyright? Is downloading the entire internet permissible if you do it for machine learning rather than to set information free? What happens when AI systems conceive inventions and seek patents?

Join IT lawyer Arnoud Engelfriet in a keynote journey through the evolving landscape of intellectual property law in the age of AI. We will unravel these complex questions with a lighthearted yet insightful analysis, drawing upon real-world examples and fostering a rich dialogue on the open-source ethos. Engage in a forward-thinking discussion that anticipates the future challenges and opportunities in IP law, inviting a collaborative approach to shaping a harmonious future between technology and law.
