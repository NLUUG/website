## Abstract

Lomiri: A Convergent Linux Operating Environment for Ubuntu Touch, Debian 13 Trixie, and Arch Linux
Lomiri is a groundbreaking Linux operating environment, originally developed as a desktop environment, that stands out for its convergent design. Unlike traditional desktop environments, which are often confined to either desktop or mobile use, Lomiri seamlessly adapts to any form factor, from smartphones and tablets to laptops and desktops. This convergence ensures a unified, intuitive experience across all devices, eliminating the need for separate interfaces or fragmented workflows.
In this talk, we’ll dive into Lomiri’s diverse use cases, its innovative architecture, and the vision driving the project. Discover how Lomiri is redefining open-source ecosystems, with full implementation on Ubuntu Touch, Debian 13 Trixie, and Arch Linux, and why its convergent approach sets it apart from the competition.
