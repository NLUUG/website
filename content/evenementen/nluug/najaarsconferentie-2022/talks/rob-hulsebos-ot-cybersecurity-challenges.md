## Abstract

“OT” (Operations Technology) systems are all around us, but hardly ever noticed, while a failure in their operation could impact society or cripple companies. However, their cybersecurity lags behind, for various reasons and this has resulted in numerous hacks with major consequences far beyond the effort needed.

In this talk, we will discuss what “OT” is, the special challenges for this (often legacy) equipment, the lack of interest in cybersecurity both from vendors and users, the usage of network protocols and stacks from the previous century, the difficulty of patching equipment and what PLC programmers themselves can do. We will also highlight the “IEC-62443” standard, specially dedicated to industrial cybersecurity.
