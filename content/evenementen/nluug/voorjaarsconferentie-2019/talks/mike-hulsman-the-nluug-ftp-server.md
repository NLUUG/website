## Abstract

A major asset of the NLUUG is the service of the FTP server. The FTP archive is a service for the open source community, and mirrors a very large number of open source packages.

In this talk we describe the history of this major hub of global software distribution and show the people and technology (ao. hardware, software and networking infrastructure) that we use to run this service now and in the near future. The method of mirroring and procedure to have a new content mirror attached will be discussed as well.
