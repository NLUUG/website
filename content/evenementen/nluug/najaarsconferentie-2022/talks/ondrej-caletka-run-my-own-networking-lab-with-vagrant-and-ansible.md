## Abstract

Today's computers are pretty powerful and capable of running a few virtual machines. In the RIPE NCC we use this potential for our e-learning courses to provide the participants a portable lab environment that is based on open source software and can run on most computers. In this talk I will demonstrate how we use tools like Vagrant, VirtualBox or Ansible to automate creation and distribution of such environments as well as some pitfalls discovered along the way.
