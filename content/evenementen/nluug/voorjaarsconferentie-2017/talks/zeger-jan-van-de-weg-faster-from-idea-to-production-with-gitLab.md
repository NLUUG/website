## Abstract

GitLab is an open source code collaboration platform. Most people aren't familiar with the extent of the features it provides. In the 8.0 release (~1.5 years ago), GitLab integrated its continuous integration platform to the main product. To this day numerous improvements have been, and are being made so our users can go faster from idea to production.

In this talk an overview of GitLab 9.0 will be shown: where it came from and where GitLab is going.

When up to speed on what GitLab could do as a code collaboration platform, focus will shift towards GitLab CI/CD. Its architecture, and how to use it in your own projects. To prove it really works as well as Zeger-Jan claims, he'll end with a demo of a full idea to production cycle.
