## Abstract

Many organisations are considering transitioning to IPv6 only when they are running out of IPv4 addresses. The canonical solution is dual stack, IPv4 and IPv6 coexisting on the same link until it's safe to shut off IPv4.
But does this really help? And is it really safe? IPv4 addresses continue to be used and some problems may remain hidden until the very last moment. Is there a better way forward?

IPv6-Mostly is a technique that allows networks to selectively pretend they are IPv6-Only, that IPv4 is already gone. Endpoints signal when they no longer need IPv4 and the network ensures that this white lie is believable.
The beauty of IPv6-Mostly lies in its ability to enable a controlled and incremental transition to IPv6-Only, and highlight where IPv4 is still needed or where it can be actually de-commissioned.

This presentation will introduce IPv6-Mostly for people who are not aware of this technique, and share some deployment experiences including both horror and success stories.
