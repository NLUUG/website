## Abstract

With the publication of MRTG in 1995, I entered the open source world. I loved it then and have been enthusiastic about it ever since. I continue to publish new tools as well as taken care of my existing projects ever since. These days I work for a small software and sysadmin shop. Whenever I create a new tool for a customer that has some general application I look for ways to publish it as open source and I often succeed.

In this talk I will be presenting a bunch of tools and associated anecdotes from my GitHub repo.
