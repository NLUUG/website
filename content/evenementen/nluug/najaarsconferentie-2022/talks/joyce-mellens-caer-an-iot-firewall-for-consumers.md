## Abstract

In this presentation, we will describe the technical design, practical UX considerations, and the limitations imposed by designing an open-source IoT Firewall for non-technical consumers. In short, this firewall begins as an out-of-band device that replaces the home router as DHCP server. It uses this position to restructures the network, containing IoT devices in isolated subnets and setting itself as the network gateway for all IoT devices in the home. From this position, besides applying some basic firewalling, it also employs an automated form of secondary authentication via whitelisting through a companion application to effectively enforce MFA.
