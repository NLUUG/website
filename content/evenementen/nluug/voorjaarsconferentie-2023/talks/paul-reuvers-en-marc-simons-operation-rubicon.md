## Abstract

In 1970 the German intelligence service BND and their American counterpart CIA, secretly purchased the Swiss company Crypto AG; at the time the world's largest seller of cipher machines to non-NATO countries. It was used to spy on at least 150 nations. In 2020, after two years of research, the German TV station ZDF, together with SRF, Washington Post, Argos and Crypto Museum, revealed the secret CIA/BND Operation RUBICON. In this talk we'll show how the intelligence services secretly purchased the company and kept it out of everyone's view, whilst creating backdoors in the products that were sold by Crypto AG. How it was used to spy on friend and foo, and how it turned Swiss Neutrality into an illusion.
