## Abstract

Cristian will provide an overview of ongoing research projects at SIDN Labs, the research arm of the operator of the Netherlands' national top-level domain, .nl. Our projects aim to increase the security of the core of the Internet and cover topics such as detecting potentially malicious domain names, collaborative DDoS mitigation and DNS resilience measurements. We typically carry them out together with our research partners, such as the University of Twente, the University of Southern California, Delft University of Technology, and NLnet Labs. We concentrate on use-inspired basic research, which for instance means that we focus on practical problems and that our results are generic and open source so that they can be used by a wide range of stakeholders, including SIDN itself to further improve its .nl services.
