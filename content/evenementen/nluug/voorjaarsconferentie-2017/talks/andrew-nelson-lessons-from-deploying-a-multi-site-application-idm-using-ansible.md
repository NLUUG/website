## Abstract

Ansible is a very useful orchestration tool allowing for consistent and repeatable results, however what happens when you need to run Ansible but cannot repeat an action more than once, or need to orchestrate some servers being configured before others? This presentation will discuss these and other lessons learned from a deployment of Red Hat IdM (FreeIPA) using Ansible.
