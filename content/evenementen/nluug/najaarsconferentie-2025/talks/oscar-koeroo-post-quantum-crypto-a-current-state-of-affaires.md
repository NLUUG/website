## Abstract

In this presentation I’ll share a technical and more strategic view on the current state of the post quantum cryptography transition. It’s a slow process, but why is this? Reconfigure your machine and each should be done? What are the hairy spots of the transition? Which choices are still open? Some choices have been made. I’ll also share where The Netherlands stands and a view point from the EU on this technical matter.

## Biography

I’m Oscar Koeroo, I work in the cyber security space since 2003. I started at Nikhef as a computerprogrammer in C. Working with OpenSSL and libcurl I helped secure large HPC/HTC infrastructures. In 2013 I moved to KPN in the CISO office. I briefly joined the Red Team and moved to the policy team and grew to be the team leader for the team responsible for the cyber security policy and BCM. In 2021 I switched to the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports as the department CISO or CISO Concern with a responsibility to digitally security all organisations under administrative control of the minister. As such, I work together with other ministries and also in EU collaboration on PQC. I have a specialty in applied cryptography, large infrastructures, crisis management and complex governance structures.

At home and work I’m a Debian and MacOS user. The commandline is my weapon of choice. What I learn in my homelab hobby space might end up back into my workspace.

I guest lecture applied cryptography at the Leiden University. At the Security Academy I teach cryptography practisioner and quantum safe cryptography essentials.
